# CertiX Project Code of Conduct

## Introduction

The CertiX project is dedicated to providing a safe, inclusive, and welcoming environment for all contributors, regardless of their background, identity, or experience. To maintain a respectful and collaborative community, we have established this Code of Conduct that applies to all project participants, including contributors, maintainers, and users.

## Our Standards

The following behaviors are expected and encouraged among all participants:

- **Be Respectful:** Treat all individuals with respect, kindness, and empathy. Disagreements and differing opinions are part of the development process, but they should remain constructive and focused on the project's goals.

- **Inclusive Language:** Use inclusive language and avoid any form of discrimination or offensive comments related to personal attributes such as gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, or age.

- **Collaboration:** Work together with others to achieve common project goals. Respect and value the contributions of each team member.

- **Professionalism:** Demonstrate professionalism in all interactions, including discussions, emails, issue tracking, and code reviews.

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered unacceptable and will not be tolerated:

- **Harassment:** Harassment, intimidation, or any other form of abusive, discriminatory, or derogatory conduct is not acceptable within the CertiX project. This includes verbal, written, or visual comments that create an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment.

- **Personal Attacks:** Personal attacks, insults, or any form of unwarranted hostility towards other participants are not tolerated.

- **Bullying:** Bullying, trolling, or any form of disruptive behavior intended to harm or intimidate others is unacceptable.

## Reporting Violations

If you witness or experience behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please report it by contacting the project maintainers or administrators at [contact-email@example.com].

All reports will be treated confidentially. Project maintainers will review and investigate any complaints and take appropriate actions.

## Enforcement

Violations of this Code of Conduct may result in consequences, including warnings, temporary or permanent bans from the project, or other actions deemed necessary by the project maintainers.
